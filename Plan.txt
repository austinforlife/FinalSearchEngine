Descriptions of roles, specification of work to be done, description of the unit tests, list of classes and interfaces to be written. 
This should be submitted during discussion section on paper, and also in a group GitHub Repo shared with the professor and TA. 
In the case of needing extra tools, initial research on sample code (for web server, for parsers etc) should also be evident by 5 December.

2.) 
---Greater-than: 
Class: Make new class called GreaterThan. 
Method: greaterThan returns a list of Fields whose Field values are alphabetically
larger than the Field value specified in FieldSearch.
Test 1:
Load in some data. Make new Field and FieldSearch objects. Use method greaterThan on the
FieldSearch object. Use an assertEquals statement to check that the number of Fields
returned equals the correct amount from the data. 
Test 2:
Similar to test 1. Use the greaterThan method on a FieldSearch object, and use an
assertEquals statement to check that the Field values returned are the ones alphabetically
larger than the Field value specified in the FieldSearch object.
---Less-than:
Same as Greater-than above, but with Less-than. 

3.) Combinations of searches
Class: Make a new class, ComboSearch.  
Method: andSearch takes 2 FieldSearch objects as input and returns a list of identifiers 
that satisfies the intersection of the two types of searches. Similarly, orSearch takes
2 FieldSearch objects as input and returns a list of identifiers which satisfies the
union of the two types of searches.
Test 1:
Put in some data. Make two FieldSearch objects as input for the andSearch method. 
Use an assertEquals statement to check that the number of identifiers returned equals 
the number of identifiers that match both the first and second FieldSearches.
Test 2:
Put in some data. Make two FieldSearch objects as input for the orSearch method. 
Use an assertEquals statement to check that the number of identifiers returned equals 
the number of identifiers that match the first FieldSearch + the number of identifiers 
that match the second FieldSearch - the number of identifiers that match both FieldSearches.

4.) String Parsing
Class: make a new class StringParser.
Method: 1 parseString takes one string as input and returns a list of substrings split by quotes and commas.
2 performSearch: Based on the kind of search it wants, it passes the field name and value to relevant search class.
Test 1: Give a long string to the parseString method and assertEquals to see if the list returned can match
Test 2: Using the result of parseString and let performSearch find the result. Using assertEquals to check if the
value returned matches with the correct result.

We have decided to use Single Responsibility principle, Open/Close principle in our implementation.
